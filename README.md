# Dev Diaries

Welcome to my dev diaries — a raw and real log of my learning journey through whatever makes me stop and ask, “wait — how does that work?.

This repo is where I break things down in my own way — simple, honest, and clutter-free. I believe in learning deeply, thinking out loud, and writing for *my future self*.

I’m not here to sound fancy — just making sure I *understand what I learn*, one step at a time.

### **Just what made sense to me, when I learned it.**
